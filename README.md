# TDA Report - Data Catalogue & Next Steps

This repository hosts both the **Data Catalogue** and the **Next Steps** for the *Technical Documentation Assessment Report* (TDA Report) system. The project aims to simplify the creation of a highly detailed technical document, traditionally compiled using Word, by gradually transitioning to a more agile and digital format.

## Project Goal
The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured and well-documented data foundation that facilitates the generation of the TDA Report in an efficient manner, improving data management and simplifying the documentation process. The report will be compiled online, allowing centralized and easily accessible management of the information.

## Repository Contents
- **Data Catalogue (Markdown)**: The data catalogue for the TDA Report generation. It defines the various elements that make up the report.
- **Next Steps (Markdown)**: A Markdown file that outlines the future actions and improvements for the systemâ€™s implementation and evolution.
- **Possible PDF**

## Future Updates
This repository is designed as a showcase for now.
