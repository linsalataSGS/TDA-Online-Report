- [ ] Optimize PIC/CAR sections (i.e.:
	- if the assessment declares that is "not acceptable", then, only in that case do we need PIC/CAR?, or...
	- let's leave the opportunity to write PIC also when the Assessment declares Acceptability?);
- [ ] We are revising with Szymon and Jennifer the citation! (To be completed)
- [ ] How to handle Clinical Reviewer and Final Reviewer Roles;
- [ ] Date & Time Logics 4 Metrics;
- [ ] About Metrics: create Report in Ariadne (?) and/or Power BI;
- [ ] Develop some MLL to improve the work;
- [ ] Optimize CSS (Style in general?) / Vue.js (maybe trying a POC?)

- [ ] About  a more "Data Centered" process: 
	- DigiApp/ CertIQ, ... How can we **centralize** or streamline processes and flow/pipeline of data?...
		![[Pasted image 20250417163550.png]]
		In DigiApp, as an example, we already have those field in picture that are automatically populated from CertIQ: can we do that trough Ariadne (Our TDA Demo)?
	- maybe also applicable code we can inherit from DigitApp?
	- Or better: talking with Szymon, I understood that they have this folder: [WebsitePDFs-ReadyForPublication](https://sgs.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/BEKNNB1639IVDR/Shared%20Documents/Marketing/WebsitePDFs-ReadyForPublication?csf=1&web=1&e=1VpmrU "https://sgs.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/beknnb1639ivdr/shared%20documents/marketing/websitepdfs-readyforpublication?csf=1&web=1&e=1vpmru"), and inside it there’s a file called **LPIVDREG1010 PIQ** — that is s a sort of “magical” PDF that contains all the fields my team usually copy into the TDA Header (the first page) of my TDA Demo in Ariadne. He raised up, in fact, the need to inherit data from the PIQ. I soon asked Dmitry and he replied that it is impossible to develop a transport from an editable PDF.
