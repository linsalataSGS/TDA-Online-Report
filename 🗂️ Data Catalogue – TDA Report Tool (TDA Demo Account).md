- **Dynamic Behavior:**  
    The use of a reference table allows full flexibility: when new paragraphs are added to the reference, the list of requirements can be extended accordingly.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è However, when updating the list of paragraphs, it is **crucial to also update the Prefilled Set** in the configuration of the subordinate table `REQ`, in order for the new paragraphs to be included properly.
